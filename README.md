## Objectives

- Library to process remote sensing imagery using GPU and CPU parallelization.
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning image classification and regression.
- Agnostic array and vector-like data structures.
- User interface environments via Notebooks for easy to use AI/ML projects.
- Example notebooks for quick AI/ML start with your own data.

## Installation

The following library is intended to be used to accelerate the development of data science products
for remote sensing satellite imagery, or any other applications. tensorflow-caney can be installed
by itself, but instructions for installing the full environments are listed under the requirements
directory so projects, examples, and notebooks can be run.

Note: PIP installations do not include CUDA libraries for GPU support. Make sure NVIDIA libraries
are installed locally in the system if not using conda/mamba.

## Why Caney?

"Caney" means longhouse in Taíno.
